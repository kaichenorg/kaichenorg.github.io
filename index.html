									<h2>CommanderSong: A Systematic Approach for Practical Adversarial Voice Recognition</h2>
									<p>We find that the voice commands can be stealthily embedded into songs, which, when played, 
										can effectively control the target system through ASR without being noticed by a human listener. 
										Our CommanderSongs can be done automatically against real world ASR applications. 
										In addition, they can be spread through Internet (e.g., YouTube) and radio, 
										potentially affecting millions of ASR users.

									<h2>Following Devil's Footprints: Cross-Platform Analysis of Potentially Harmful Libraries on Android and iOS</h2>
									<p>We report the first systematic study on PhaLibs across Android and iOS, based upon a key observation 
										that many iOS libraries have Android versions that can potentially be used to understand their behaviors
										 and the relations between the libraries on both sides.[<a href="share/">data</a>]</p>

									<h2>Finding Unknown Malice in 10 Seconds: Mass Vetting for New Threats at the Google-Play Scale</h2>

									<p>Our malware detection platform, MassVet, detected over 100,000 potentially harmful apps (PHA). 
										Among them, 10,000 PHAs are missed by VirusTotal. MassVet can also detect app privacy 
										in a large scale, over millions of apps, in seconds. For more details, please refer to our paper. 
										Or you can use MassVet to analyze Android apps at Android Malware Detection Platform.

									<h2>Achieving Accuracy and Scalability Simultaneously in Detecting Application Clones on Android Market</h2>

									<p>Besides traditional problems such as potential bugs, (smartphone) application clones on Android markets 
										bring new threats. Existing techniques achieve either accuracy or scalability, but not both. 
										To solve those problems, we use a geometry characteristic, called centroid, of dependency graphs to 
										measure the similarity between methods (code fragments) in two apps.
