A somewhat unusual but interesting responsive site template. I did this one to test out a
new pattern set I put together and I think it really came together well. As for use cases
it's kind of unspecific so hey, use it for whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

## TODO

### Trim and re-construct People page

- There are **too many duplicated information** in People introduction.
- I recommend to rebuild the structure of personal introduction like:

```markdown
[Avatar]
Name: [FirstN LastN](personal website link) 中文名
Education:
    - 20XX - 20XX AAA University, Major, Bachelor
    - 20XX - 20XX IIE, CAS, Major, Master/Ph.D.
Research Interests: A, B, C
Email: XXX@iie.ac.cn / or some
```


### Use an easy-maintaining framework

Find a framework and try to migrate.
